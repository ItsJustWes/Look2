What is the Marketplace feed?
      The Marketplace feed is a file containing an XML representation of the Clickbank Marketplace. It is intended for individuals who would like to have access to the full marketplace without having to "scrape" it from the site. The file is in Zip format to reduce its size during download, the file must be unzipped before it can be parsed or viewed. Tools such as Winzip can perform this task.

Where can I get the marketplace feed?
      The marketplace feed is available by clicking here: 
      
      !!! marketplace.clickbank.net/marketplace/feeds/marketplace_feed_v1.xml.zip !!!
      
      I tried to open the marketplace feed in my browser and my browser had trouble with it.
      The marketplace feed is very large! It is not intended for use with a browser, but rather for use with programs that parse large amounts of XML data.

What is XML?
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format. More information can be found about XML at www.w3c.org/XML. Also available in the marketplace feed file is a .DTD file, which defines the structure of the XML file. The XML link above also has information about .DTD files.

Is this an RSS Feed?
      The marketplace feed is not an RSS feed. It is a large file and is not meant to be read more than once per day.

How often is the Marketplace feed updated?
      The ClickBank Marketplace feed is updated every day at approximately 5:00 am Pacific Time, at the same time that the Marketplace is recalculated.

Will other versions of the Marketplace feed become available?
      Clickbank expects that, over time, changes will be made to the feed. Each time a new feed is released, it will be given a new version number. Clickbank will make every attempt to maintain old version numbers, however no guarantees are made that all older versions will be maintained.

Can I download the marketplace feed frequently?
      The marketplace feed only changes once per day. There is no reason to download it more than once per day.
